	<h1>How it works</h1>

	<h2>Draw case: </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter the number of nodes and click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Generate Graph </span>button</li>
		<li>Choose whether it is a directed grpah or undirected</li>
		<li>Drag and drop nodes to adjust their position</li>
		<li>To add an edge, click on the first node then click on the second node</li>
		<li>
			To delete an edge, follow the same above step <br>
			<span style="font-weight: bold">Note: </span> in Case of directed grpahs you have to click on the source node then on the destination node (in order)
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>The test case follows the typical format in all graph problems:<br>
		The first line consists on two integers, (n) & (m), where (n) is the number of nodes and (m) is the number of edges<br>
		(m) lines follow, each containing two integers (i) & (j), meaning that there is an edge between node (i) and node (j)
		</li>
		<li>The app currently supports unweighted graphs only.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Random case:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter the number of nodes and the number of edges.</li>
		<li>Select the properties of the graph (Edges bi-directionality and weight).</li>
		<li>Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Generate Case </span>button</li>
		<li>The test case follows the typical format in all graph problems:<br>
		The first line consists on two integers, (n) & (m), where (n) is the number of nodes and (m) is the number of edges<br>
		(m) lines follow, each containing two integers (i) & (j), meaning that there is an edge between node (i) and node (j)<br>
		If the graph is weighted, the edges line will contain the weight of the edge as a third integer.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can copy the test case directly from the panel on the right.
		</li>
	</ol>
